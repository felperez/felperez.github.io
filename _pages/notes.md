Here I will list the reading groups or seminars in which I will be participating/organising. I will also occasionally upload some notes taken at each of the seminars. My notes can (and will usually) be a bit sloppy, and I declare myself responsible for any mistakes in them.

**Notes on probability theory and statistics:** here I will post notes on a variety of topics related to probability theory which are of my interest in one way or another. They have an expository character while keeping the formality.

**M.I. Gordin, On the central limit for stationary processes:** this is a *very* rough translation of the paper by Gordin, where he introduced the martingale approximation method to derive statistical results in dynamical systems. [Russian original](/files/Gordin-rus.pdf)/[English translation](/files/Gordin-eng.pdf).

**Bowen's formula and transfer operators:** [here](/files/bowen.pdf). In these notes I present a sketch of the proof of the Bowen's formula for the Hausdorff dimension of the repeller of an IFS, as well as introducing notions of thermodynamic formalism.

**Sizing small sets:** [here](/files/pps.pdf). These are the slides of a talk that I gave in the Pure Postgraduate Seminar. Here I introduce the notion of Hausdorff dimension and how can it be used to compare sizes of sets of measure zero. I present some number theoretical results concerning dimensions of certain sets, as well as sketch of the connection to dynamical systems and ergodic theory.

**Chaos and order:** [here](/files/chaos.pdf). This is the sketch of the talk that I have in the 3 Minute Thesis competition, which was chosen for the final stage. The video of the talk can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9WJXjCynx4&t=7s).
