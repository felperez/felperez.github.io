I am Felipe Pérez, a third year PhD student of the University of Bristol under the supervision of [Thomas Jordan](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~matmj/). My main interests are Ergodic Theory and its relationship with Dimension Theory. I did my undergraduate and masters degree at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile under the supervision of [Godofredo Iommi](http://www.mat.uc.cl/~giommi/). During the (calendar) year 2019 I will be visiting Professor [Matt Nicol](https://www.math.uh.edu/~nicol/) in the University of Houston, Texas.
