Here I will list the reading groups or seminars in which I will be participating/organising. I will also occasionally upload some notes taken at each of the seminars. My notes can (and will usually) be a bit sloppy, and I declare myself responsible for any mistakes in them.

**Fractal Weyl laws. This reading group was held on the first term of year 2016-2017:**
