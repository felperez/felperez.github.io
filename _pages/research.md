**One dimensional dynamics**

![Gauss map](/files/gauss.png)

**Dimension of measures:** for a sufficiently nice map of the unit interval $[0,1]$ and an invariant ergodic probability measure $\mu$, the Hausdorff dimension of such measure can be expressed as the quotient between the entropy $h$ and the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$, that is, $ \operatorname{dim}_H \mu = \frac{h}{\lambda}$,  when the entropy is finite and the Lyapunov exponent is non-zero. Furthermore, it is known that the local dimension exists almost everywhere and it is also equal to $\frac{h}{\lambda}$. The case when the entropy and the Lyapunov exponent are both zero has been studied by Ledrappier-Misiurewicz and Katok, who constructed examples of such maps and measures for which the local dimension does not exist almost everywhere. I am interested in studying the case when both the entropy and the Lyapunov exponent are infinite.

*Dimension of measures with infinite entropy, (Submitted).* [https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04612](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04612)

*In this paper, we prove that for a large class of Expansive-Markov-Renyi (EMR) maps and a Gibbs measure, the lower local dimension is zero almost everywhere (and hence the Hausdorff dimension of the measure is also zero), while the upper local dimension is equal to the convergence exponent of the Markov partition defining the map (and hence, the packing dimension is equal to the convergence exponent). We also prove that the symbolic dimension exists and is also equal to the convergence exponent of the map.  The class of maps considered includes the Gauss map, generalized Lüroth maps as well as a large class of maps modelled by countable Markov shifts.*

The results from the paper above show that it is possible to develop a theory in this setting.

**Self-affine measures** for self-affine iterated functions systems (IFS), the Hausdorff dimension of the underlying self-affine set can be expressed in terms of the subadditive pressure (associated to the Falconer potential). The measures of equilibrium for such pressure are known as Käenmäki measures. I am interested in studying the statistical properties of such measures.

# Talks and notes:

**My research:** [here](http://felperez.github.io/files/research.pdf) I explain my research, the area of investigation and the kind of questions we try to answer. This is written in a format accessible for non-mathematicians.

**My Master's thesis:** [here](http://felperez.github.io/files/thesis.pdf). I give a general introduction to ergodic theory with emphasis in Thermodynamic Formalism. In the last chapter, I prove that the dimension of the Borel-Bernstein depends analytically on the parameter.

**Slides of my thesis presentation (in Spanish):** [here](http://felperez.github.io/files/slides.pdf). These are the slides I used when presenting my Master's thesis. They contain a summarized  version of the results of my thesis, as well as some ideas of the proof.

**Bowen's formula and transfer operators:** [here](http://felperez.github.io/files/bowen.pdf). In these notes I present a sketch of the proof of the Bowen's formula for the Hausdorff dimension of the repeller of an IFS, as well as introducing notions of thermodynamic formalism.

**Sizing small sets:** [here](http://felperez.github.io/files/pps.pdf). These are the slides of a talk that I gave in the Pure Postgraduate Seminar. Here I introduce the notion of Hausdorff dimension and how can it be used to compare sizes of sets of measure zero. I present some number theoretical results concerning dimensions of certain sets, as well as sketch of the connection to dynamical systems and ergodic theory.

**Chaos and order:** [here](http://felperez.github.io/files/chaos.pdf). This is the sketch of the talk that I have in the 3 Minute Thesis competition, which was chosen for the final stage. The video of the talk can be found here.

**Infinite entropy and zero dimensional measures (poster):** [here](http://felperez.github.io/files/poster.pdf). This is a poster I presented at several conferences.
