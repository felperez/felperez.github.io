## One dimensional dynamics

![Gauss map](/files/gauss.png)

**Dimension of measures:** for a sufficiently nice map of the unit interval $[0,1]$ and an invariant ergodic probability measure $\mu$, the Hausdorff dimension of such measure can be expressed as the quotient between the entropy $h$ and the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$, that is, $ \operatorname{dim}_H \mu = \frac{h}{\lambda}$,  when the entropy is finite and the Lyapunov exponent is non-zero. Furthermore, it is known that the local dimension exists almost everywhere and it is also equal to $\frac{h}{\lambda}$. The case when the entropy and the Lyapunov exponent are both zero has been studied by Ledrappier-Misiurewicz and Katok, who constructed examples of such maps and measures for which the local dimension does not exist almost everywhere. I am interested in studying the case when both the entropy and the Lyapunov exponent are infinite.

*Dimension of measures with infinite entropy, (Submitted).* [https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04612](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04612)

*In this paper, we prove that for a large class of Expansive-Markov-Renyi (EMR) maps and a Gibbs measure, the lower local dimension is zero almost everywhere (and hence the Hausdorff dimension of the measure is also zero), while the upper local dimension is equal to the convergence exponent of the Markov partition defining the map (and hence, the packing dimension is equal to the convergence exponent). We also prove that the symbolic dimension exists and is also equal to the convergence exponent of the map.  The class of maps considered includes the Gauss map, generalized Lüroth maps as well as a large class of maps modelled by countable Markov shifts.*

The results from the paper above show that it is possible to develop a theory in this setting.

**Limit laws of sequential and random dynamical systems:**

The classical limit laws apply for sequences of random variables with some degree of stationarity. For instance, a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem hold for a class of martingales and a class of ergodic stationary processes. We can extend these notions by considering processes arising from sequential and random compositions of different dynamical systems acting in the same space. The resulting systems are non-stationary. While several laws have already been proved, I am interested in Large Deviations and Central Limit Theorems for such systems.


## Two dimensional dynamics

**Self-affine measures** for self-affine iterated functions systems (IFS), the Hausdorff dimension of the underlying self-affine set can be expressed in terms of the subadditive pressure (associated to the Falconer potential). The measures of equilibrium for such pressure are known as Käenmäki measures. I am interested in studying the statistical properties of such measures.

[These](https://people.math.osu.edu/bergelson.1/vb_Kyoto8Nov04.pdf) notes by Vitaly Bergelson give insightful historical remarks on the ergodic theorem.

**My research:** [here](/files/research.pdf) I explain my research, the area of investigation and the kind of questions we try to answer. This is written in a format accessible for non-mathematicians.

**My Master's thesis:** [here](/files/thesis.pdf). I give a general introduction to ergodic theory with emphasis in Thermodynamic Formalism. In the last chapter, I prove that the dimension of the Borel-Bernstein depends analytically on the parameter.

**Slides of my thesis presentation (in Spanish):** [here](/files/slides.pdf). These are the slides I used when presenting my Master's thesis. They contain a summarized  version of the results of my thesis, as well as some ideas of the proof.

**Infinite entropy and zero dimensional measures (poster):** [here](/files/poster.pdf). This is a poster I presented at several conferences.
