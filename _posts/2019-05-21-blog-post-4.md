In this entry we will discuss the Borel-Cantelli lemma. Despite it being usually called **just a lemma**, it is without any doubts one of the most important and foundational results of probability theory: it is one of the essential zero-one laws, and it allows us to prove a variety of almost-sure results.

Suppose that $A_1,\dots$ is a sequence of events in $\Omega$. We define its limsup as the sets

$$
\limsup_n A_n = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty \bigcup_{k=n}^\infty A_n.
$$

In other words, $\limsup A_n$ can be thought as the set of points $\omega\in\Omega$ belonging to infinitely many of the sets $A_n$. The Borel-Cantelli lemma gives us conditions for when the limsup of the sequence has either full measure or zero measure.

**Theorem (Borel-Cantelli):** Suppose that

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mathbb{P}(A_n) < \infty .
$$

Then

$$
\mathbb{P}\left(\limsup_{n} A_n \right) = 0.
$$

**Proof:**
