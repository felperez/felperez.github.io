This is the first post of a series of 4 posts based on the lectures at the [Houston Summer School on Dynamical Systems 2019](https://www.math.uh.edu/dynamics/school/school2019/) on Statistical properties in hyperbolic dynamics, given by Matthew Nicol, Andrew Török and William Ott. These notes are heavily edited with added comments, examples and explanations. Any mistake is of my responsibility. Some of the notation has been changed for consistency.

## Lecture 1

The goal of these lectures is to understand statistical properties of dynamical systems by using some tools from probability theory. For this, we will introduce first some language and notation.

### Random variables

Let $(\Omega,P)$ be a probability space. A *random variable* is a measurable funcion $Z\colon\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$. A stochastic process is a sequence of random variables $(Z_k)$ in the same probability space. The distribution function of a random variable $\phi$ is the function

$$
F_Z\colon(-\infty,\infty)&\to[0,1] \\
F_Z(t) &= \mathbb{P}(X\leq t)
$$

**Example:** a random variable $Z$ has \emph{normal distribution} (denoted by $Z\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$) if
\begin{align*}
	F_Z(t) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \int_{-\infty}^t \exp\left(\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)dx.
\end{align*}

$$
\begin{align_}
2x - 5y &= 8 \
3x + 9y &= -12
\end{align_}
$$


A stochastic process $(Z_k)$ is \emph{stationary} if for every $n\geq 0$ and every sequence $A_1,\dots,A_k$ of measurable sets, we have
\begin{align*}
	P(X_1\in A_1,\dots,X_k\in A_k) = P(X\in A_{1+n},\dots,X_k\in A_{k+n}).
\end{align*}

This means that the joint distribution of the random variables does not change over time.
