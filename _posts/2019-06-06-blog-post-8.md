This is the third post of a series of 4 posts based on the lectures at the [Houston Summer School on Dynamical Systems 2019](https://www.math.uh.edu/dynamics/school/school2019/) on Statistical properties in hyperbolic dynamics, given by Matthew Nicol, Andrew Török and William Ott. These notes are heavily edited with added comments, examples and explanations. Any mistake is of my responsibility. Some of the notation has been changed for consistency.

## Lecture 3

In the previous two lectures we introduced the transfer operator and the martingale approximation to transfer limit laws results from martingales to dynamical systems. In this lecture we will use the decay of correlations of regular observables to deduce statistical properties of dynamical systems.

The setting is as in the previous post: let $T\colon X\to X$ be a non-singular transformation of the probability space $(X,m)$. For observables $\phi,\psi\colon X\to\mathbb{R}$, define their correlation function by

$$
C_{\phi,\psi}(n) = \int_X \phi\cdot \psi\circ T^n dm - \int_X \phi dm \int_X\psi dm.
$$

Note that $C(\phi+a,\psi +b) = C(\phi ,\psi)$ for any pair of real constants $a,b$, so we can assume that the observables have zero mean. The first question we are interested in solving is:

**Question:** can we find an invariant measure with good properties?

By good properties we mean a measure **not** supported on periodic orbits and absolutely continuous with respect to the reference measure $m$.

## Perron-Frobenius theorem

We recall the well celebrated theorem in one if its probabilistic formulations.

**Theorem (Perron-Frobenius):**

Let $A$ be a positive matrix. Then there exists a maximal simple real eigenvalue $\lambda$, and its associated eigenvector can be chosen with positive entries. The rest of the eigenvalues are contained in a disk of radius strictly smaller than $\lambda$.

The previous theorem describes de structure of the spectrum of a positive matrix. One of the main consequences of this theorem is the construction of a stationary measure for Markov chains. We will not go into the details of the proof of the theorem as that will be studied later on in the context of Birkhoff cones. In what follows we will focus on the infinite dimensional analogue of the Perron-Frobenius theorem.

## Infinite dimensional results

The previous theorem can be extended for infinite dimensional spaces. The notions of eigenvalues and spectrum are more delicate in the infinite dimensional case, so we will define the right notions to generalize the previous theorem.

Let $(\mathcal{B},\| \cdot \|)$ a Banach space and $L\colon \mathcal{B}\to \mathcal{B}$ a bounded linear operator with spectral radius $\rho(L)$. We say that $L$ has *spectral gap* if it has a single simple eigenvalue on the circle $\{ z : \|z \| = \rho(L) \}$ and the rest of the spectrum is contained in a disk of radius strictly smaller than $\rho$.

While this is the property we want to obtain for the transfer operator, we will define a weaker notion which is easier to prove.

We say that $L$ is *quasicompact* if $\mathcal{B}$ can be written as direct sum $\mathcal{B} = F\oplus H$ and a positive number $0 < \rho < \rho(L)$ such that
1. $F$ and $H$ are closed and $L$ invariant,
2. $\dim(F) < \infty$ and all the eigenvalues of $L\|\_F$ have modulus larger than $\rho$,
3. The spectral radius of $L\|\_H$ is strictly smaller than $\rho$.

Quasicompactness and spectral gap holds trivially for operators in finite dimensional spaces. If an operator is quasicompact, there is a unique eigenvalue on the circle $\{ z : \|z \| = \rho(L) \} and this is simple, then $L$ has spectral gap.
