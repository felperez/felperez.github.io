This is the first of a series of entries where we will explore several limit laws for sequences of random variables. The setting is going to be the standard for probability theory: fix a measure space $\Omega$, a sigma-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ and a probability measure $\mu$. By random variables we mean measurable functions $X\colon \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$. The distribution of $X$ is defined as $F(x) = \mu(\omega: X(\omega) \leq x )$, so $\mu( a \leq X \leq b  ) = F(b) - F(a)$. If the measure $\mu(A) = \mu(X^{-1}(A))$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$, we denote the Radon-Nikodym derivative by $f = \frac{d X^{-1}\mu}{d \mu}$ and hence we can compute probabilities as integrals of this function with respect to the measure $\mu$:

$$
\mu(A) = \int_A f d\mu.
$$
