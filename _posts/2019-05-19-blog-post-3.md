This is the first of a series of entries where we will explore several limit laws for sequences of random variables. The setting is going to be the standard for probability theory: fix a measure space $\Omega$, a sigma-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ and a probability measure $\mathbb{P}$. By random variables we mean measurable functions $X\colon \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$. The distribution of $X$ is defined as $F(x) = \mathbb{P}(\omega: X(\omega) \leq x )$, so $\mathbb{P}( a \leq X \leq b  ) = F(b) - F(a)$. If the measure $X^{-1}\mathbb{P}(A) = \mathbb{P}(X^{-1}(A))$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mathbb{P}$, we denote the Radon-Nikodym derivative by $f = \frac{\mathrm{d} X^{-1}\mathbb{P}}{\mathrm{d} \mathbb{P}}$ and hence we can compute probabilities as integrals of this function with respect to the measure $\mathbb{P}$:

$$
\mathbb{P}(X \in A) = \int_A f(x) \mathrm{d}\operatorname{Leb}.
$$

We call $f$ the density of the random variable $X$. The expectation of $X$ is defined by $\mu = \mathbb{E}(X) = \int_\Omega X \mathrm{d}\mathbb{P} = \int_{\mathbb{R}} x \mathrm{d}  F(x)$ where the second integral is in the sense of Lebesgue-Stieltjes, and the variance by $\sigma^2 = \int_\omega X^2 \mathrm{d}\mathbb{P} - (\mathbb{E}(X))^2 = \mathbb{E}(X-\mu)^2$.

Now we suppose we have a sequence of iid random variables $X_1,X_2,\dots$ with distribution $F$. We are interested in describing the limit behavior of the averages

$$
S_n = \dfrac{X_1+\dots + X_n}{n}.
$$
