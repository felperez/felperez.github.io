This is the first of a series of entries where we will explore several limit laws for sequences of random variables. The setting is going to be the standard for probability theory: fix a measure space $\Omega$, a sigma-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ and a probability measure $\mu$. By random variables we mean measurable functions $X\colon \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$.
