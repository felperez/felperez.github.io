This is the first of a series of entries where we will explore several limit laws for sequences of random variables. The setting is going to be the standard for probability theory: fix a measure space $\Omega$, a sigma-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ and a probability measure $\mathbb{P}$. By random variables we mean measurable functions $X\colon \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$. The distribution of $X$ is defined as $F(x) = \mathbb{P}(\omega: X(\omega) \leq x )$, so $\mathbb{P}( a \leq X \leq b  ) = F(b) - F(a)$. If the measure $X^{-1}\mathbb{P}(A) = \mathbb{P}(X^{-1}(A))$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mathbb{P}$, we denote the Radon-Nikodym derivative by $f = \frac{\mathrm{d} X^{-1}\mathbb{P}}{\mathrm{d} \mathbb{P}}$ and hence we can compute probabilities as integrals of this function with respect to the measure $\mathbb{P}$:

$$
\mathbb{P}(X \in A) = \int_A f(x) \mathrm{d}\operatorname{Leb}(x).
$$

We call $f$ the density of the random variable $X$. The expectation (mean) of $X$ is defined by $\mu = \mathbb{E}(X) = \int_\Omega X \mathrm{d}\mathbb{P} = \int_{\mathbb{R}} x \mathrm{d}  F(x)$ where the second integral is in the sense of Lebesgue-Stieltjes, and the variance by $\sigma^2 = \int_\omega X^2 \mathrm{d}\mathbb{P} - (\mathbb{E}(X))^2 = \mathbb{E}(X-\mu)^2$.

Now we suppose we have a sequence of iid random variables $X_1,X_2,\dots$ with distribution $F$. We are interested in describing the limit behavior of the averages

$$
\dfrac{S_n}{n} = \dfrac{X_1+\dots + X_n}{n},
$$

where $S_n = X_1+\dots +X_n$. Intuitively, the averaging of the independent observations of the same distribution should smooth out and regularize the random fluctuations of the random variables around the mean. This is the content of the weak law of large numbers:

**Theorem (Weak law of large numbers):** Assume that the iid sequence $(X_n)$ has finite variance. Then $(X_n)$ converges in distribution to $\mu$.

Recall that convergence in distribution means that for any $\varepsilon > 0$,

$$
\mathbb{P}\left(\left\|\frac{S_n}{n}-\mu\right\| > \varepsilon\right) \to 0
$$

as $n\to \infty$.
